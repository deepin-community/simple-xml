Description: XML serialization and configuration framework for Java
 Simple is a high performance XML serialization and configuration framework for
 Java. Its goal is to provide an XML framework that enables rapid development
 of XML configuration and communication systems.
 This framework aids the development of XML systems with minimal effort and
 reduced errors. It offers full object serialization and deserialization,
 maintaining each reference encountered.
 In essence it is similar to C# XML serialization for the Java platform, but
 offers additional features for interception and manipulation.
